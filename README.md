### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

Iâ€™m a software engineer currently living in London, UK. I mostly program in [Go](https://golang.org/).

Iâ€™m one of the authors of a [book about Docker](https://www.amazon.com/Docker-Production-Trenches-Joe-Johnston-ebook/dp/B0141W6KYC).

I also started [Kubernetes London Meetup](https://www.meetup.com/Kubernetes-London/).

I occasionally blog [here](https://cybernetist.com/).
