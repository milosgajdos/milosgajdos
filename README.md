### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I like to program things.

Iâ€™m one of the authors of a [book about docker](https://www.amazon.com/Docker-Production-Trenches-Joe-Johnston-ebook/dp/B0141W6KYC).

I am one of the maintainers of the original container registry aka [distribution](https://github.com/distribution/distribution).

I was heavily involved in development of one of the most popular Go microservices frameworks [go-micro](https://github.com/go-micro/go-micro).

I occasionally blog [here](https://cybernetist.com/).
